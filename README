Copy of esspa10 (no LM, sfct with Hamming, NH3 with SINC) for delivery to JPL.

Objective is to have all necessary files in this directory.

Modified  rslib/util/retr/BackgroundModule.f90 to fix bug found at JPL :

Hi, Igor
 
After some effort I found the line of code that was causing a segmentation fault: in BackgroundModule.f90 the
combineBkgSfcIR routine has an incorrect line:
 
                dback0(sParG:eParG)=this%emRfExt
 
This should be :
 
dback0=this%emRfExt

Also modified GranuleReadModule.f90 to allow reading of different versions of the L2 data

Today I found that I had ignored the fact that water vapor from L2 mmr relative to moist air. This may impact
the retrievals slightly and should be fixed in the next round, along with the surface temperature retrieval.

Correct conversion is below:

mmr_nh3_d = mmr_nh3_w*(1+(mmr_wv_w/(1.0-mmr_wv_w))

Then convert mmr_d to vmr_d as is already done in the code
